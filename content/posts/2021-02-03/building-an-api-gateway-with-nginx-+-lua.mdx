### Building an API Gateway with Nginx + Lua

Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. Nginx could be used to create an API Gateway that processes requests in an event-driven manner, handling queries to the server in a quick, low-resource-footprint manner as they come in. Further, it reduces complexity and maximizes the performance by reducing the average response time to serve an API call.  

Most of us are already familiar with Kong but, I wanted to explore the possibility of using OpenResty to build an API Gateway.

### <U>Implementation</U>
The first thing we need to do is to install OpenResty. OpenResty gives us the capability of scripting Nginx using Lua.  

Once installed, you should navigate to your browser and type http://localhost. If everything goes well, you will see the below screenshot:

With this, you have successfully installed OpenResty along with Nginx.  

Now, we need to edit the __*nginx.conf*__ file. You can find the nginx.conf file in the below locations:  

- *Ubuntu : /usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf*
- *Mac: /usr/local/Cellar/openresty/nginx/conf (using homebrew)*

Note: You can also add the configuration in a new file and include it in __*nginx.conf*__.

<!-- ![API Gateway with Nginx and Lua!](diagram.png "API Gateway with Nginx and Lua") -->

For a basic API gateway, there are two important operations that it should perform:

1. __Routing__
2. __Authentication__

### <U>Routing</U>
To route the endpoints to their respective servers, all you need to do is:

```nginx:title=/nginx.conf
location /api/test {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/api/test;
}
```

### <U>Authentication</U>

To perform authentication, I will be using JWT. To do that, we need to install the __lua-resty-jwt__ library using __OPM(OpenResty Package Manager)__.

```bash
opm get SkyLothar/lua-resty-jwt
```

Next, create a __*jwt-auth.lua*__ in */usr/local/openresty/lualib/resty* (Ubuntu) and copy the below code:

```lua:title=/jwt-auth.lua
local jwt = require 'resty.jwt'
local validators = require 'resty.jwt-validators'

if ngx.var.request_method ~= 'OPTIONS' and not string.match(ngx.var.uri, 'login') then

  local jwtToken = ngx.var.http_Authorization

  if jwtToken == nil then
    ngx.status = ngx.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED
    ngx.header.content_type = 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
    ngx.say('{\'error\': \'Forbidden\'}')
    ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED)
  end

  local claim_spec = {
    exp = validators.is_not_expired()
  }
  
  local jwt_obj = jwt:verify(‘secret’, jwtToken, claim_spec)
  
  if not jwt_obj['verified'] then
    ngx.status = ngx.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED
    ngx.header.content_type = 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
    ngx.say('{\'error\': \'INVALID_JWT\'}')
    ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED)
  end

end
```

The above Lua code does the following:

1. It forwards the request to the next line of execution if it is an OPTIONS call or a login API.
2. Otherwise, it fetches the JWT token in the Authorization header. If the token is not present, the code returns ‘FORBIDDEN’.
3. This JWT token is then validated for authenticity and expiry date.
4. Once the token is validated, it forwards the request to the respective service. Else, it returns ‘INVALID_JWT’.

Include the above file in your __*nginx.conf*__.

```nginx:title=/nginx.conf
location /api/test {
    access_by_lua_file /usr/local/openresty/lualib/resty/jwt_auth.lua;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/api/test;
}
```

That’s it. You have added JWT authentication on Nginx.

### <U>Testing</U>

To check the changes we have made, restart __OpenResty__ using the below command

```bash
sudo service openresty restart
```

Once you restart, hit the API using Postman or any other REST client and validate the response.

__*Tip:*__ *You can generate JWT tokens using this website: http://jwtbuilder.jamiekurtz.com/*

### <U>Todo</U>

We can improve our auth script by doing the following:

1. A mechanism to add new API endpoints that don’t need a JWT token like downloads API.
2. Currently, JWT secret token is hardcoded in the script. Maybe we could set it as an environment variable to make it dynamic.
